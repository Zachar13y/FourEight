“Thank you Chris. Sometimes I do NOT like the perspectives you provide but I do need to hear them. No matter what I always felt supported by you and like there was hope for me to get better.”

“Honestly Chris, you are one of the best therapists I have ever gotten to talk to! Thank you for everything.”

“Very attentive; very responsive to concerns; kept a safe space by maintaining a regular group attendance and keeping conversation on topic and triggering statements out and explaining how and why they are triggering in a thorough manner, thereby educating the group without shamming anyone.”

“Loved this group, 10/10 would recommend to a friend.”

“Thanks for making this group one of the very few groups of mine that is not something pushed or pressured with specific topics. It made me feel more human here.”

“Chris helped me recall the events of the summer in a real way, not the sugarcoated version I had subconsciously created.  His questions made me dig deeper and talk about this like a hadn’t before. Chris has the ability to pull things out of my subconscious that had been sitting there some time.”

“Chris is my favorite therapist I have ever met with. I have been a client of two other therapists in my past and I feel that I gained much more with Chris than with either of these therapists. I believe a few factors made Chris such an efficacious therapist. To begin with, I really appreciated the methods Chris used to assist me. I found that his use of REBT and CBT were extremely effective. Also, I really appreciate Chris’s focus upon self-efficacy. Lastly, I found that Chris had a very good energy. It was obvious that Chris cared about my issues and was genuinely trying to help me. Moreover, Chris was caring while also maintaining professionalism. “
